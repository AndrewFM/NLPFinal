**Project Paper**: [https://www.overleaf.com/read/whkmwfmtbsxd](https://www.overleaf.com/read/whkmwfmtbsxd)

A NLP-based QA system for answering user queries via a knowledge-base built from Stack Exchange info. Uses a Bag-of-words classifier for predicting question categories, a hierarchical classifier for answer type prediction, and then a pattern extraction algorithm for summarization.

Use `easy_install py-stackexchange` to get the StackExchange API for Python on your computer.
